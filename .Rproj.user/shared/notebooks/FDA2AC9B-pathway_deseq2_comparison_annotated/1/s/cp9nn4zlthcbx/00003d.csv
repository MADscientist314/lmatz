Pathway abundances were inferred from DADA2 derived ASV count matrices and taxonoimcally classified using DECIPHER against the Silva138 database. A comparison across diabetes status was conducted using DESeq2 with an upstream independent filtering of pathways containing less than 10 detected counts. Results for significance was corrected for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction."",digits = 3)"
